config SPIRIT_NETDEV
	bool "STMicro Spirit1-based Network Driver"
	default n
	select WL_SPIRIT
	---help---
		This selection enables support for the TMicro Spirit1-based device.
		This configuration generates an IEEE802.15.4 work-alike radio device that
		works with the 6LoWPAN stack.

if SPIRIT_NETDEV

config SPIRIT_PKTLEN
	int "Fixed packet length"
	default 96
	range 1 96 if !SPIRIT_FIFOS
	range 1 65535 if SPIRIT_FIFOS
	---help---
		Fixed pkt sizes are used.  This setting describes that fixed packet
		size.

config SPIRIT_FIFOS
	bool "FIFO Watermarks"
	default n
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		The Spirit hardware can provided interrupts when indicate when the
		RX or TX FIFOs are almost full or empty.  This is useful for
		supporting very large packets, larger than the FIFO size.  The RX/TX
		FIFO size is 96 bytes.  As long as the packet size is less then or
		equal 96 bytes, this feature is not needed.

		NOTE:  Marked experimental because this feature is not yet implement
		(hooks are present).  You should not enable this feature unless you
		plan to implement the feature.

config SPIRIT_PKTLEN
	int "Fixed packet length"
	default 96
	range 1 96 if !SPIRIT_FIFOS
	range 1 65535 if SPIRIT_FIFOS
	---help---
		Fixed pkt sizes are used.  This setting describes that fixed packet
		size.

config SPIRIT_MTU
	int "MTU"
	default 596
	---help---
		6LoWPAN support fragmenting and reassembly of large IPv6 packets.
		Each fragment will be up CONFIG_SPIRIT_PKTLEN in length.  An single
		IPv6 packet maybe fragment into several such frames.  This setting
		provides the MTU which is the largest fully assembled IPv6 packet
		that can be sent.

config SPIRIT_PROMISICUOUS
	bool "Promiscuous mode"
	default n
	---help---
		Disables all address filtering.  Otherwise, filtering the node
		address will be supported.

config SPIRIT_MULTICAST
	bool "Multicast address filter"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables address filtering for the multicast addess 0xee.

config SPIRIT_BROADCAST
	bool "Broadcast address filter"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables address filtering for the broadcast addess 0xff.
